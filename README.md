# pico_epaper_73

Firmware for [7.3inch ACeP 7-Color E-Paper Photo Frame](https://www.waveshare.com/photopainter.htm)  
   
Compared to original Waveshare firmware:
- can load 1 bit BW, 4 and 8 bit palettized, and 24 bit "waveshare format" bmp files
- no limit on number of images (original firmware has limit of 100 images)
- loads images faster
- uses less battery
- displays status bar

Plans for the future:
- build instructions and binaries
- measure current draw
- document how time can be set
- allow turning off the status bar
